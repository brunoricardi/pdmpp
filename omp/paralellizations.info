omp0: 5/26/2021, started from opt2. OMPed most inner-most loop in squaring. No good; 62 s
omp1: 5/26/2021, OMPed r2 loop in squaring. No good; 60 s -> it seems like the overhead of creating/cleaning threads in the inner loops is killing it
omp2: 5/26/2021, OMPed r1 loop in squaring. No good; 102 s -> private(i,j) seems to be doing it twice. private(i) only gives segfault
omp3: 5/26/2021, OMPed wave loop in squaring. Good; 1:76s 2:71s 4:67s s -> it is becoming clear that squaring is not a big deal for this particular test
omp4: 5/26/2021, Free particle loop (not much improved) and interaction loop (this was great). 1:57s 2:29s 4:14s 8:10s 16:13s
omp5: 5/26/2021, Initial expression for waves fully parallelized, each squaring is parallel too. Really good; 1:65s 2:36s 4:18s 8:12s 16:5s
omp6: 5/26/2021, Partial wave sum is parallelized. Great results too.
